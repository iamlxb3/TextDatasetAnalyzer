It took a moment for me to catch the picture and see my reflection . I had no intention of seeing it , so I took a moment to appreciate it . The photo I had taken was the same one with the photo I had on my wedding day . I could have taken it out of that photo , and I could have been there . <newline> <newline> It felt so easy . <newline> <newline> I had to be careful , I thought as I sat down on the beach , my mind on the beach I was in . I had to know what would happen to me . I would be there with no way to know if it was my fault . I could have made sure it was alright . But I did n't . I had to know if it was alright to
You . <newline> <newline> You were the one who gave her everything . Gifts , money , your love ... You gave her everything . So why did it feel so bad ? <newline> <newline> You . <newline> <newline> You were n't handsome , nor were you ugly . What could you say , you were yourself . Your parents had always told you to try your best , to apply yourself and you would succeed . So why did n't you ? <newline> <newline> You . <newline> <newline> You cried when she had left . Citing all the scrapbook moments you had shared . Yet she had ripped that book apart , somberly smiling as she said it was over . <newline> <newline> You . <newline> <newline> You could hear his car outside , a brand new model . Some Ferrari or Porsche probably . She stood at threshold and turned around tears running down her sobbing face .

The rain poured down on the forest 's surface as she sat on the porch . The sun was just starting to fall over the trees in her backyard . She took a sip of water from her mug , a small smile on her lips . <newline> <newline> The world seemed to change as a small forest slowly faded away . She looked over to see a man standing there . She did n't seem to mind . His dark hair was matted to his shoulders and his body was tattered by the rain . The sky seemed to grow darker and the sky seemed to brighten up with the clouds above . A single drop of rain fell down her neck as he stared down towards the sky . <newline> <newline> A woman approached him . She stood and took out her purse , which was now empty
Konrad clamped his jaw shut not allowing himself to cry . He sat alone in his cabin , sounds of hurry and panic and boots on metal from the corridor breached his room . He stood up . almost tipping over either from exhaustion or that his shoes had melted through beyond all recognition and usefulness . His skin still felt the heat , his hands , his face , his eyes ached . Rushing over to the mirror to check for damage , shoes barely able to keep up he was for the most part unhurt but his skin glowed a painful red . He gingerly applied cool water to his hands and face still tender from his ordeal . Out of habit he thought to remove his ring and shut his eyes tight , clamping his jaw even tighter . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Through the merchant class window with forehead pushed up against the glass he saw
The day came like it had always been . <newline> <newline> My eyes were watering , the rain was pouring down on me . I had been sitting at dinner all day , staring at the sky in wonder , and I wanted to go home . The sun was rising over the horizon , I could barely see any other colors . <newline> <newline> I was so hungry , I did n't feel any pain . I was tired , I could n't go home . My heart began to pound . <newline> <newline> I sat up , a bit of the feeling of exhaustion was coming over my mind , the last thought I had of my life . I sat up , and looked at my watch . It was time to go home . I turned on my heel , and ran . I was so
Lancelot ran back into the Round Room . Arthur still stood there , clutching the hilt of Excalibur which protruded from the rock in the middle of the room . <newline> <newline> Lancelot screamed , `` My king , everyone is out . I escorted the Lady Gwynevere myself . The knights have completed a full sweep of the castle . We are the only two left . '' <newline> <newline> Merlin had warned Arthur that this day would come . The earth below Camelot had been sinking for months . The lake which once served as the castle 's moat was now a series of vast cliffs . Cliffs with a bottom that stretched beyond the eye 's sight . But this morning the end was upon the castle . The magic of Excalibur could no longer hold the center beam of the castle aloft . Today Camelot would fall .
The old man sat quietly on the porch , his fingers wrapped around the cold brass key in her hand as they slid down to the cold steel of his leather coat . The door creaked as he stepped inside , his feet brushing the floor as he stepped out of the door . His feet were bare with his feet , his hands wrapped around his hips like he was in a dream . <newline> <newline> He walked down the hall , his boots crunching on the stone floor as he passed through the door . He walked past the door and into the hallway before walking through the room . He walked past the two doors , and stopped before a large oak door which sat next to the bed . He walked through the door , the lock sliding as he walked . His mind raced ,

A man stood before a man dressed in black and white . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` I have to go , I have n't been able to find a way to find you . '' The man said , his eyes scanning the world before them . <newline> <newline> <newline> The man stood before them with a look of shock , before he looked them over . The man looked at his friend , he was looking at the man , he looked back at the man in disbelief . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` You can come with me , you can come with me . It 's no surprise that you 're here , right ? '' The man said , his voice sounded as if they were crying for their mother . He looked at the man and said , `` I can not promise to return you
Of all the people in the city , it had to be Lopez . We had something of a history together , you might say . I think he enjoys this , likes watching me squirm . Of all the cars to be stuck in , I got his . I just had to go for the flashy sports car . Maybe I deserved this one . <newline> <newline> He drove in silence for miles . He knew I didn ’ t have a choice but to sit and listen to the noise of the radio . <newline> <newline> “ Like the seats ? ” he eventually asked . <newline> <newline> I hate this guy . The fake leather wasn ’ t fooling anybody . It was well-traveled , unable to hide the wear . I ’ d already been acquainted with it , so I didn ’ t even dignify the question with a response .
It 's been a few years since we met , a little over three years since the accident . I had been working on some of my most popular work . A few weeks back I met up with another girl at a bar , and she was nice enough . We had a nice place for a little over two weeks , and we were in love . I met her a few years back after my promotion , which was great because she said that she 'd come for me for me to live with , and I had an idea , that she would n't want me to live with her . <newline> <newline> She had a pretty good name . <newline> <newline> I got married after she moved in . I met a friend . She was a bit of an ass . And the girl
Amber . Her hair , not her name . Amber , like the crystallized goo that hardens around mosquitoes so you can extract DINO D-N-A and terrorize Jeff Goldblum . <newline> <newline> She gets in and the crushed scent of pine floats in with her . California is something else this time of year . Her bag goes into the backseat of the beat up Camry and she sighs . <newline> <newline> `` Thank you . I only get a stop every hour or so ; it 's been slow . '' Her voice is a mesmerizing tune hummed low across a harp . <newline> <newline> `` No problem . I 'm heading North up towards Oregon , '' I rush out , a little disarmed by her soft voice . `` I 'm just shooting straight up the interstate . You ? '' <newline> <newline> `` North is perfect .
`` You need to go '' the doctor said , her eyes were closed . She took a long look at the man . He was young , and he looked like he had been on the run forever , and he was a pretty good athlete . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` I 'll go . '' she said , and walked over to a tree on a side road . <newline> <newline> <newline> He pulled out a knife and stabbed the man . Blood began to trickle from her chest and she collapsed . He looked up and saw the man in the tree , and the tree was the only man there . He looked at the man again , and smiled , and went to get the knife . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` You 're not the only one '' the man said , before he
# # # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap ) <newline> <newline> We were flying low over the inhospitable terrain , which glowed with a blazing heat barely contained by the obsidian surface of the planet . The official designation for the planet below us was designated M92 Alpha Hermes IV ( colloquially known as Planet Hell among some of our more colorful team members ) , and it was an unusual specimen of a planet . The entire surface was obsidian , with occasional flows of lava breaking through . It was dark as well , as the only light that reached the planet for most of the year was from the heat of molten rock . A nearby celestial body , M92 Alpha Hermes III , despite astronomical odds of against such a thing happening , maintained an orbit around the system 's star that blocked most of the light from M92 Alpha Hermes .
It was a long day , and everyone was ready to go . The day before , everyone was ready , waiting for the inevitable . It was time to go . Everyone was excited , ready to take the stage . Everyone was ready for the new world , and everyone would know the new life as they had so many years ago , and the next . <newline> But nobody had come for the new world . It was time to go . The people were going to have to go home early . The new world would be a new one , and the new world would be a new one . But it was time to go home . The people were ready to leave and be ready for the new world . They had a new world . The new world was one and the
I hate you . I hate the way that you laugh and the way that you look and everything about you I hate , and in fact I hate you because you make me hate you . <newline> <newline> Remember when those kids used to tease you in school ? Everything that they said was true . `` You 're too fat , you should kill yourself . Now you 're too skinny , you should eat more . You 're ugly , where did you get those clothes , a concentration camp ? '' <newline> <newline> You are what I despise , and today for the first time since I 've known you , I 've realized that we are fixed on each other . I ca n't leave you and you ca n't leave me . I hate you . <newline> <newline> Maybe at the end of this day when I get home it will all be over
The man looked out upon the city . It had been three days since the bombs dropped . They were all dead now . <newline> <newline> He looked at the world , it was the only thing left that mattered . He could hear the sounds of the world coming closer . He could hear the world around him fade into the distance as the sky darkened . He could see the world around him fade and fade as a new star fell from the sky . The earth was now empty and there was nothing he could do . He sat there , as the world faded away into fade . He looked at the world around him , the world faded and the world faded from existence . <newline> <newline> <newline> The world faded away into the darkness and his thoughts turned to reality . The world faded
He punched walls , smashed holes into them with his fists . She sat in the bathroom and cried . <newline> <newline> He screamed and raged at the sky , used his ax to split wood so that he did n't split apart himself . She sat in the bedroom and cried . <newline> <newline> He did n't speak , only sat silently while people told him to be strong . She sat on the couch and cried . <newline> <newline> He went into her church , prayed for God to tell him `` Why ? '' She sat in the backyard and cried . <newline> <newline> She screamed at the sky , begging God to answer her `` Why ? '' He sat next to her and cried . <newline> <newline> Laying together under the blazing sun , emotions spent and eyes tired , they cried . <newline> <newline> Spread apart on the bed , an empty space between
The old man 's hand trembled against the old man 's back . `` You have to understand . I 'm an old man , old . '' The old man sighed . `` I 'm not afraid of heights or the old man was old . '' He looked at the old man with a frown . A man with the cane was sitting at his foot . The old man smiled again . He wore a long , black cloak with the same black cloak as the man who sat at the old man 's back , his cane in hand . He was dressed in long dark robes and a hood . The cane on the right of the cane had n't been seen in days . <newline> <newline> `` You 're a good man , I know . You are n't afraid to go out .
There was the thought of sea , and a shore , of a lighthouse burning bright and a setting sun , of water crystal clear and teeming with fish , and in the distance a ship sailing to the open seas . Jonas held the bottle between his fingers , and with a sudden twist turned it lengthwise , the seas glistening just beneath the bottle 's neck . <newline> <newline> He held the bottle up to his eyes and looked through the prism of the glass . The sea and sky were painted in bright pastel colors , but the ship and the shore and the man standing upon it were a dead unknowable black . The scene sloshed , gleaming like a rainbow slick of gasoline . Jonas lifted the bottle to his mouth and breathed in a heady air . In that bottle was a child 's hapless dream of the sea , seen through aquariums and
I am the only one who understands this . The first human to understand the power of the universe , the only one who understands what 's outside the boundaries of the world . The first human to understand this ... The first human to learn that everything was the same . The first human to understand it . I 'm not sure what it 's about it . I am the one with all of the human emotions . I do n't understand why it happened to the other human . We 're the only one . The one who understands this and it 's not like I can understand . We 're the only one in this room . We 're the only one . I am the only one . The only one who understands the truth . We can not communicate with them . We
`` Well , fag , any ideas ? '' <newline> <newline> Fyodor scoffed at the name picking , glaring at the pale blond though the eye that was n't covered by a patch of hair . <newline> The pair had decided to take a trip by the Siberian tundra , trying to investigate some late happenings as told and rumored by the people in the area . <newline> Naturally - according to the own Alexandr - Fyodor could n't go on his own because he would probably be eaten by a bear or mauled by dressing like a girl . <newline> *Literately* dressing like a girl . <newline> <newline> `` If it 's not the bear , your town fold would go out and kill you in any case .

The game of Sims plays . <newline> <newline> I 've been doing this for over 3 years now and I 've never played anything . I 've always hated this game . It 's a game that does n't change the world , even when I do , and the game 's only ever so slightly . I 'm pretty sure that I 'm the best at it , even if there is a game , and a player that does n't want it . My game was always so boring and so repetitive it was a game , but it had never been played before . I 'm not sure what to do . <newline> <newline> I 've always had this feeling . I 've always had this feeling . It was like I was going to die , but I just did n't . <newline> <newline> My life
I was looking through the mailbox when I found a package that said , `` Merry Christmas . '' When I brought it home , I ripped through the paper and saw that it was a new game . A free video game ! I set up the game on my PC and instantly started playing . The character information popped up . There was an elf , a swordsman , and a magician . Being the magic-lover that I am , I chose the magician . I named her Aisha . She looked like a real person , with her brown eyes and blonde hair . Using the arrow keys , I veered Aisha to some gates , only to be stopped by some men who started lecturing me about the dangers that lurked outside , blah blah blah . I ignored them and stepped out of the gates .
The room was dark . <newline> I sat in the back chair and I heard a muffled voice coming from the door . <newline> <newline> `` Come in ! I do n't want to get caught up in these things ! '' I heard a man shout through the door . <newline> <newline> `` You have to take this . '' I heard a man 's voice say through the door , but he was right . The door slowly opened . He looked over his shoulder , his face was still pale and pale , but there was nothing he was familiar with . I looked back down and saw a man , with long black hair . <newline> <newline> `` Who ... '' The man said with an air of authority . <newline> I turned to see the man standing there , wearing a suit and tie .
In a strange world in a strange time , there once lived the Creatures of Light and Creatures of Dark , split between a Great River that ran between a land bordered by an impassible fog . <newline> <newline> To the East , the creatures of light inhabited great plains of gold , who 's surface moved as water in the gentle breeze . Everywhere the eye turned , all that could be seen were flowers of every shape and size that painted the rolling hills as an iridescent rainbow of colors that begged the eyes to never look away . High above the land , the proudly shinning sun gave life and beauty to a land below that stretched as far as anyone could see into the impassible fog . In the middle of the plains stood an immense tree of such age and height that the creatures of light spoke of the tree as eternal .
They call it a miracle . They do n't know who they are . They 're a good idea - they do n't know who they are or what they have done . But what they do know is that they ca n't tell us who they are . <newline> <newline> They call it a gift . The curse that can not be shared . And they call it an abomination . A gift that will be bestowed by God , a gift that we can not bear . <newline> <newline> It is an ugly thing that I can not resist . They are so afraid that we will be cursed as we can not forget the words of an enemy they had chosen . I do not understand the words that have come out in the end , but I do understand their fear . I do understand how
**Kuhio Highway** <newline> <newline> “ Let ’ s pick up the next hitchhiker , ” I say . I ’ m venturing out because I ’ ve never told him that I think picking up hitchhikers is an awesome thing to do . So many people think every hitchhiker is a potential serial killer that is going to attack you while you ’ re driving . <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , that sounds fun , ” my husband says . I 'm so happy I did n't even have to convince him . <newline> <newline> We were driving down Kuhio Hwy from Hanalei to Poipu Beach . Kauai was the best vacation we ’ d ever had so far . We stopped in every town , looking for the authentic Hawaiian experience , hitting antique shops and small diners . We even stopped at a house off the highway where a family was selling barbeque in their front yard .
I looked over the city 's surface . I was sitting at my desk , sipping from my mug as I stared at the skyline of the city . It seemed like the most boring city in existence , and I had nothing left to do . But I wanted to go home and live with my wife . I was tired of my job . It was my job to live with the people I loved . <newline> <newline> I sighed and walked down the street . It was a nice job , but I was n't sure about that . I got into my car and drove out to the city . I had to get to work . It made me feel like I was on the road again , and I was hoping I would n't be seeing anyone in the city . My eyes were
Never Ending <newline> <newline> <newline> *Breathe . 1…2…3* <newline> <newline> <newline> Ella watched as soft violin notes passed blissfully through the air . Cosmic rifts tore in and out of the creamy white sky , and the small sewn cat of her youth tugged at her sleeve . Looking down she also could see that she was wearing the same clothes , it was the same clothing every time she came here . A white blouse pulled over black jeans , and red boots with a thick heel . She was lucid dreaming again . Or at least that ’ s what it felt like each time she came here . A perfect world blended from her safest thoughts and memories . From when things were better , from when she wasn ’ t so alone . The sewn cat continued to tug and pull at her sleeves , gesturing down a beaten path .
I was on the brink of death and it was only a temporary reprieve from the cold . I had been sitting there with a bottle of water for hours , the water dripping from my face onto the floor . The water was n't a pleasant temperature , but a warm and inviting sort . I was sitting there on the bed , and the water was n't a comfortable temperature . As I tried to get up , and I saw the light on my face . <newline> <newline> I stood and looked to my side . I could feel the warmth of my blood flowing to the sides of my face . I knew I had to . I could see my hands shaking in anticipation , I had to . My hands were shaking in anticipation as my hands fumbled around the handle . I reached
We had been out here for months , but in truth it felt like years . Living close to other people was never something i liked . Here on the mining ship *Stars Bounty* space was limited and privacy was even less so . I was not trained to be a spacer i am a paramedic i trained for four years in the trauma capital of the world . I was not the best student back then but i knew what i was doing , and now here i am in deep space . <newline> <newline> The drive to mine out here was not a new thing but it was not possible until the invention of the RED drive . invented by Ray `` Edge '' Dalton , it was one of those pleasant coincidences that the universe sometimes give us , that the drive emitted a red glow . <newline> <newline> Now I am here treating miners in deep

No matter how different the world changed the world changed . <newline> <newline> The new world changed . It changed . <newline> <newline> It was time for the next world change again .

The man stood up to the podium as the crowd cheered and the crowd cheered . The man stepped forward into the crowd of people who were now cheering and cheering as he walked out of a room to celebrate the momentous occasion he had been in . He sat down at a podium , and the applause from the crowd , filled with cheers and cheering and applause as he walked up to the podium . The crowd cheered , and all the others smiled as he took one last deep breath . <newline> <newline> `` The first one is n't that hard .

He looked around at all the applause for the first time in years and looked back and forth as the cheering crowd turned and
The sun spits a fire across the hood of my car as we barrel down Route 17 . Twisted hunks of metal side-railings swing past us ; ghostly remnants of rubbed-off paint flashing and scorching in the heat . Tuneless echoes of America 's glory days hang in the air , threatening the drought like an attempt to call some presumed bluff . <newline> <newline> The hitchhiker sits there looking to his right out the window like a battle-worn demon-hunter -- tired but ready to fight at any moment . <newline> <newline> I say , `` It 's a great day . I 'm glad that the sun is finally out . '' <newline> <newline> There is no movement for a moment . The sun beats . <newline> <newline> I say , `` Where are you headed ? '' <newline> <newline> He says , `` Camden . You can drop me off wherever , though .
The man 's voice was like a choir of angels 's angels 's horns and horns , like a harp 's harp , like the song from a concert that was a concert of a harp , like a harp , like a lullaby and the music of the choir . He wore bright , blue , blue eyes that glowed with a light that could be considered the light of a dead sky . His arms were bound and wrapped around his body , and they were in a leather chair that was n't in any condition for any human body . His face was like that of a child 's , and the color was that of a child 's that had been born and died from the birth of a child . But he carried on . A child 's voice , like a lullaby that it

Here on the mining ship *Stars Bounty* space was limited and privacy was even less so . I was not trained to be a spacer i am a paramedic i trained for four years in the trauma capital of the world . I was not the best student back then but i knew what i was doing , and now here i am in deep space . <newline> <newline> The drive to mine out here was not a new thing but it was not possible until the invention of the RED drive . invented by Ray `` Edge '' Dalton , it was one of those pleasant coincidences that the universe sometimes give us , that the drive emitted a red glow . <newline> <newline> Now I am here treating miners in deep
It started on the morning of June 3rd , 2018 . It was a Wednesday afternoon and I was walking home from school today with my girlfriend and I . We were sitting at my table and I saw my phone on the counter . I did n't want to see it again but I knew it was going to be one of *those* days . I was hoping to see some news , but as soon as it happened , it went up . <newline> <newline> I sat down and I saw a video of something that would change the course of history forever . I did n't really know anything about it and I was wondering why I was n't interested in what I was wondering until after it had been announced . <newline> <newline> `` It 's not important . '' the man said as a voice
Of all the people in the city , it had to be Lopez . We had something of a history together , you might say . I think he enjoys this , likes watching me squirm . Of all the cars to be stuck in , I got his . I just had to go for the flashy sports car . Maybe I deserved this one . <newline> <newline> He drove in silence for miles . He knew I didn ’ t have a choice but to sit and listen to the noise of the radio . <newline> <newline> “ Like the seats ? ” he eventually asked . <newline> <newline> I hate this guy . The fake leather wasn ’ t fooling anybody . It was well-traveled , unable to hide the wear . I ’ d already been acquainted with it , so I didn ’ t even dignify the question with a response .
`` Hey honey , what are the odds of this all ? '' I asked her as I stared out the window at this wonderful , beautiful planet . It was a beautiful place , I could see her as much as I did , I could see her eyes shining as they were the color of the sunset , it was beautiful and beautiful ; I knew her smile and I could see the beauty of her eyes . I knew that if I was going to marry her , I could have her in my heart . But I was too scared to leave her with this woman and her happiness . She had no idea what she was going to do with this . `` Hey babe , what 's the matter ? '' I asked her as I began to feel a bit uneasy . ``
I rolled my window down despite the wall of water descending from the heavens . Wearing a jacket pulled close , the stranger loped to the car door , spraying water with each step . Not sure if I could be heard above the storm , I motioned for my new travelling companion to jump in with me . Before I could even say a word , the hitchhiker 's arms were around my neck . My entire body tensed with anticipation for my impending doom until I realized ... .it was a hug ! Why was this soaking stranger from the side of the street embracing me in the front seat of my car ? <newline> <newline> `` I 'm confused , '' I finally admitted . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry ! '' You need to understand that at this point , I had n't seen more than the eyes and general shape of this person .
`` You 're not even the same age as me ! You have no idea how long I 've been doing this . I 'm not even a teenager . You 're the only one , you know what I 'm talking about . '' <newline> <newline> The man 's a tall woman . He 's wearing a long black coat and a dark brown tie that falls down to his waist . He holds a small smile and looks to it that he has n't noticed it yet . He 's wearing a long grey suit and a white tie with his eyes fixed upon the grey coat he has . <newline> <newline> She looks up and she smiles back . There was a slight smile on her face and that smile was there . He took a moment and smiled back . `` I know . '' <newline>
I know how the bastards will say it happened , `` Johnson was repairing the engine house and an arc from his welder cut the tether . We tried everything , but with the damage from the explosions , we retrieve him . Thank Quayle he fixed the engine enough for us to get home before cutting himself loose .

She had a lot to do today . It had a lot of fun at that , but she wanted to be the person who was going to die . And it was time to go . She wanted to go back to the city to try again , and find a place . She was so happy to be the one that was going to be there . This was going to be a wonderful day . <newline> <newline> It had been an hour since she was able to make an appointment to go home and find out why she had to be the man to be the man .

The world is n't always compliant with our wants . Life doesn ’ t work the way we desire it to . It ’ s not that the universe is against us . This is the paradox that exists . All around us , change happens , and evolution occurs and continues without us . We are the ones that build the walls in the middle of this river and are devastated when our static addition doesn ’ t take root and hold firm . <newline> <newline> Unlike the predictions of unavoidable self-destruction and nuclear apocalyptic futures , humanity eventually figured it out . People were able to shed their dependencies on those destructive fuels , both old and new , that were burning up our world . Society was able to become just that , one society thriving together , a harmonic concerted effort to save itself . And after holding strong to the principle , we were able
I was a boy . It had been years since I had left the house to find it was a waste of time and energy . Now , I 'm sitting here with my family , watching the stars in the night sky . <newline> I 've been living the life of a woman , my family , my family . I 've lived a long and happy life , not knowing that my wife , who I 've been living in for the last two years , has been my wife . My husband , I 've had my life , had my life . My husband is an amazing man . He is an awesome man , but I love him . <newline> My life is so exciting . I 'm not going to live to see my wife again or my wife . I 've always felt
`` A little wormy '' Jezkin wiggled his pinky , imagining it wet and dirty . `` That 's all '' His breath puffed out in the cold forest . He reached down and touched the thread tied around his waist . He wanted to tug it , but knew he was n't meant to yet . <newline> <newline> The sound of a stick cracking made Jezkin gasp and look up . The first snow of the season had just fallen and as the sun died , turning the sky gold , then bruised violet the snow went from glimmering white to gray . In the trees nothing moved . No shapes but the natural . Jezkin 's small heart slowed back down . <newline> <newline> `` Are you lost , child ? '' Jezkin spun and almost slipped . The soft voice had come from behind , but no one was there now .
It 's a shame , really . They said I 'd be the one , but that was for sure . I would have never been so afraid of death , and now it 's time for me to move on . <newline> <newline> The sun rises above the horizon as I step forward and look around . I do n't see the city below me , but I know I am in a city of thousands . <newline> <newline> I know I am in the right direction , and I am not afraid . If I do not get up , I do not feel like me . I do not feel like my body is going to be here , because I am afraid . I am not afraid . I am afraid that I will never be able to face the world again . I am afraid
Here comes Lad , jabbing his walking stick into the mountainside every other step . His loyal companion trails close behind wanting shoes . The scene is chilling . A titanic stone valley shoots alarmingly fast into a crevice without life . <newline> <newline> Lad sees the mourning sun cast pink ; It grieves over the hero . <newline> <newline> At least , everybody assumes it 's a hero . Or was . Adding a certain atmosphere to the valley is a skeleton , which would be titanic but that word has already been spent on the mountains . It 's far more impressive than those craggy peaks , for bones are normally smaller . <newline> <newline> A hundred Lads could fit in the eye socket . <newline> <newline> Faced with the immense remains of a not-so-forgotten warrior ( he 's part of the local religion ) , Lad can only wonder one thing .
The cold breeze was getting closer . The rain was getting closer , and closer . The wind was making her skin curl ; its warmth was getting warmer . The wind was getting closer , and closer , but they had a point . <newline> <newline> She reached into the bag , but the cold was making the wind turn to cold . The wind was starting to make the air shift . <newline> <newline> She pulled out the bag , and pulled out a small , white paper . <newline> <newline> She had been working at a small factory a week back when she would go to the factory , and buy some food for her and the factory . <newline> <newline> She looked down at the paper in front of her , and the tears were now flowing from her eyes . <newline> <newline> She put the
`` We will die soon if we do n't make it '' , said the commander of the Moronian vessel as he rubbed his gelatinous face with his tentacled appendages . <newline> <newline> Their race had traveled the universe for centuries following the stellar trail of high frequency radio waves that were always a sure sign of intelligent life . And intelligent life meant nourishment . <newline> <newline> `` Commander , we 've traced the trail back to a small blue planet in the Milky Way quadrant . It should only take us 3 minutes to arrive - then we can begin feeding . '' <newline> <newline> `` Excellent '' , said the commander . `` Prepare the infantry !

*One more day . Just one more day* <newline> <newline> I ca n't remember life before The Fitting . I was , I think , a builder . A bricklayer ? It seems for far back . It *is* so far back . Two hundred and forty nine years , three hundred and sixty four days ago . *Two days more . * <newline> <newline> The Fitting . Ah yes . The Fitting . The day the armor was forced upon me by a rotten toothed old hag . If the armor fits , she said , I would be the next . I did not want to be next . I wanted to go home to my wife , I wanted to kiss my children goodnight , I wanted to pour a pint of ale and fall asleep in the cool November air . <newline> <newline> I had no choice .
I had been sitting in the back row for as long as I could remember and had a lot of time to think with the stories I had read in my head . The old man with the long brown hair and blue eyes was sitting next to me on the back of the line with her hand in her own pocket and her blue eyes looking at me as if it was the most beautiful thing in the world . <newline> <newline> She sat down next to me , and I took the time to say something . I took the time to think and remember what I had been thinking about and I took a deep breath and took a moment to consider it . I thought about the long time we spent together with each other in the living spaces in the mountains in the mountains in
Though we all have different interpretations of a God or Gods , we all seem to have an idea of what is mighty . <newline> <newline> Today , I found the body of a mighty being . As I climbed the mountains , searching for my brother , I came upon it in the vast landscape . It was shaped like a human , with everything in a greater proportion than us humans . When alive , it must have been able to crush entire buildings without even noticing them . <newline> <newline> A great sword , longer than my village 's river and wider than three houses lined together , stuck out of the mountain where his chest used to be , meaning there were other beings of that size . Though long since decayed , I could tell that the last expression on this great creature 's face was one of fear .
`` You 're not going to believe this . '' The voice came from the darkness . <newline> <newline> `` But I 'm sure it wo n't , '' a voice came from behind me . <newline> <newline> My face was pale . I felt no fear or fear . I knew I was n't going to be able to get out this much . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't try and stop yourself from coming . '' He whispered . I felt my hands shake and feel the cold sweat from my forehead against the cold . I could feel my heart beating faster and faster . I could feel my heart pounding faster and faster . I knew I must have a plan . I could feel the pain . It felt like I was being pulled from the inside of my body . <newline> <newline> `` You
The quad is my place of worship . I can sit by myself , read my book , study or just people watch . I 'm done with my homework today but do n't feel like heading back to my awful dorm room . Katie , my roommate is a whore and her bed is constantly full with different tenants . So I lean back and let my hair fall over my shoulder . <newline> <newline> It 's a cool fall day and the leaves are starting to change . I 'm on top of a hill so I can look down at all the little college students scurry from class to class . Although most just hang out walking lazily as they try to get through the hangover from last night . <newline> <newline> I 'm about to pack up and walk to my room when I see him .
It had been a good day , a good day of school . I was going to be late , it was going to be a good day . I was going to be late and I was going to be late , it was going to be a good day . I had been waiting for this for the past few days and I was going to be late . I did n't have much time , I was going to be late . I was going to be early and the time was coming soon . I did n't want to have to be late . I just wanted to be late . I wanted to be late and be late . I wanted my bus , I wanted my bus , I wanted to be late so I was going to make it . I wanted everyone

It was a dark , dark , and eerie silence . <newline> <newline> It was a silent silence that was filled only by silence . <newline> The silence was punctuated by the sound of footsteps and the sound of an empty box being opened and open . <newline> <newline> `` What the hell is this ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Who are you ? '' <newline> <newline> `` My name is John , my daughter . I am your wife . '' <newline> <newline> `` Where are the other women ?

The fortress hovered majestically over the desecrated land , once it was lush with greenery and life , now it was just a barren desert , a husk of its former self . <newline> <newline> The Arcane wars had defiled the soil , magic seeped into the it , making it unfit for life , the fortress which was once a center for trade now floated atop the crater which was once its home , massive chains made by the Dwarven Elders , which rattled with the echoes of its former life held the fortress in place , its notches placed in mountain sides and dunes . Tiny pieces of rubble fell from beneath the fortress , it was only a matter of time before it all crumbled it apart , the chains only delayed the inevitable . <newline> <newline> I sighed , *this is stupid* thinking to myself . <newline> <newline> I grabbed one of the chains hooked to
The wind howled through the trees . It made the trees grow colder , and its leaves grew cold as the wind blew . <newline> <newline> A man came out of the trees and knelt down beside him . His hair was short , his eyes were the color of the trees . His eyes were dark , and his hair was a bit short . He was wearing a long grey tunic , with a black leather glove and a dark hood . <newline> <newline> `` I know you are coming for me . '' The man said . <newline> <newline> The man was not a particularly tall man , but was not dressed in dark clothes . He wore a black tunic and a red hat , with a bow on the right side . <newline> <newline> `` It is not my place to talk with you .

She slipped inside the room practically before I 'd opened the door , throwing her arms about my neck as soon as the door was closed . But I let several long seconds slip by before I let myself relax in her arms , ears listening for the sounds of the matrons walking the halls . <newline> <newline> `` I missed you , Mandy , '' she whispered into my neck , and I was suddenly aware of just how thin our nightgowns were , pressed up against my chest . My heart raced even faster as I squeezed her close to me , breathing
A single hand reached behind the bar , and he lifted his arms to grab a glass . The man 's eyes were wide , but not wide enough for it to shatter . He held his hand out , and the man 's hand shook as he lifted the glass to his lips . <newline> <newline> The man 's face was red , and he wore a long black beard , and in his hand a small vial . He took it and poured the liquid , the glass to the man 's throat , and took it . <newline> <newline> He took a gulp , and he swallowed , and looked down to the drink on the other side of the bar . As he did , he reached to the side . The man 's eyes were filled with water , but there was no air in
As I trekked through the so-called `` Bloodstained Bluffs '' , I felt as though I were an earthworm passing through desecrated remains , long-ago abandoned . Birds , wing-ed scavengers , circled the giant 's carcass as though they hunted for a forgotten scrap of carrion still hanging from the great creature 's bones . The creature 's origins were a mystery , having been felled long ago before the dawn of man . Though myth and legend were inextricably intertwined with the monstrous thing 's existence , none were more credible than any other fairy tale . I had treated those who believed otherwise with disdain , all my life , and yet ... gazing upon the thing , into its soulless , hollow eye sockets , I felt a tug on my very being . As though it were a reunion with a relative only half-remembered . And that could very well be the case , with
`` This is it '' the man in front of me said . `` This is the moment where you 'll get lost and find a way to get you out . '' He took a deep breath . His face was pale , his hair was unkempt , a beard of dried sweat and stubble . But he was calm , and calm , and I was not afraid to let him down , but I knew that he was calm . He had the look of an outsider , but the look in his eyes made it worse . `` You ca n't be serious . This is your last chance to prove yourself , '' I said with a smile . `` You know what ? You can live , you can live forever and forever and live , and be forever , or you can live
Aniva crept silently along the white sand , using boulders almost her height as support . They were her boulders , her sand ; the trees in the distance were hers ; and the valley below , the rumbling valley that brought her sister to the ledge with a curious stance to see below ? It was theirs . <newline> <newline> `` How many ? '' Aniva asked . <newline> <newline> Keltie considered the question . `` By my count , there 's four regiments retreating empty-handed . '' <newline> <newline> `` Do they bear battle marks ? '' <newline> <newline> `` A few . Some lost limbs , some open wounds . One drags himself on hands and knees . '' <newline> <newline> `` Your handiwork ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I said he has his hands and knees , sister . '' <newline> <newline> Aniva could n't help but smirk .
I 'm not sure how I felt . I just wanted to sit here and write something . I do n't know how I did n't want to go into the woods with a knife in my hand and a knife on my hip . It 's hard to tell when the trees were in bloom . I 'm not sure what was going on in this world , but I was n't sure I was going to die either . I 'm still pretty sure I was going to have to go through the forest again , but I do n't want to think about this . <newline> <newline> I 'm not sure if I will ever get to see another sunset again , and it was n't even the worst that I 'd ever seen one of the trees . I know I 'm not even sure if
The sound of the shuffling of gravel at the end of the cave echoed throughout it . It was mid day , far too dangerous a time for anything to be about . Slowly the hermit crept forward , the hand carved spear in his dirty , scarred hands . His eyes lit up behind his permanent grizzly expression as he saw the sillouett of a child at the end of the cave ; the sight of another human being was amazing , but he knew to stay behind his cover . No matter what happened the creatures would never enter somewhere lightless . The child paused at the opening and turned around . <newline> <newline> `` No ! '' The man 's grizzly voice strained past a whisper , but his warning came too late as the tenticles floated by , snagging , scalding , and tearing at the young flesh ;
The man walked out of the car , down the street to the bus stop . The rain had started flowing , but he knew the path had been clear for many years . It was a beautiful place . A place where he had the best friends and friends , the best he had ever had for a girl , but that was n't the reason why she was doing it , she would be coming back soon anyway . The man had n't been going to any other place he had known for all of his life that he wanted nothing more than to live , and she seemed so happy to be with him , to live , to live , and to live . <newline> <newline> He walked in , looking at his surroundings .

The old man stood in front of an old man who lived a life of peace and prosperity . He had been walking for a few days now , and he had been walking for the past few days . He stopped to look in the direction of the old man , to see the old man 's face . He had walked right up to the old man and took a step back . It was n't a big one . <newline> <newline> `` You can go right now , old man . '' the old man called from the other side of the old man 's head .

Bas stood at the pass , examining what lay before him . Beside him , Filli pawed the ground nervously , his ears pinned back . The little mule 's sense of danger told him what awaited the master ahead , and he was n't thrilled to be on this particular adventure . <newline> <newline> Bas , bonded as he was to the creature , wryly shook his head at the mule 's , well , mulish behavior . For someone who had gone through all the Wanderings with him , Filli was always too eager to back away from untested lands . He rubbed the mule 's chin , clucking softly at the stubborn beast . Filli , having none of it , flicked his head away irritatedly . He knew the master would be going into the pass ahead , and being the loyal creature he was , he would be along for the journey .

You know , it ’ s the gun. ” <newline> <newline> He held the gun up again . He pulled the trigger and fired . He looked back up at the other side of the room . <newline> <newline> He fired again . He
`` Looks like the rain 's stopped . '' <newline> <newline> I peered out the window . Art was right ; time to get to work . `` Alright , let 's move out . '' I could hear the scraping of the stone armor as the men slowly stood . Despite the training , conditioning , and stamina spells , moving in this blasted rock suit was still a chore.. unless you popped an alacrity , but we usually only carry one each . Well , except for whoever was on point ; today that 's Cadr , so he 's carrying three : the standard one plus one for each runner . `` Lookouts say there were fourteen today and twelve got caught in the rain . That leaves two runners to take down . Should be no problem for the eight of us . '' <newline> <newline> The men did n't need the pep talk .
The rain pounded down on the city 's walls as people sat in their houses , drinking their umbrellas . They watched the rain fall , their eyes transfixed by the rain as it rolled in the wind . The city 's roof was covered in a layer of black , and a thick layer of dust hung above it . <newline> <newline> The city 's windows were boarded up , and a single man walked in . His eyes were a dark shade of green , and he carried an umbrella . It was a strange shade of grey , and it did nothing for a man who did not look up . <newline> <newline> The man was an ordinary man . But a man was born in the city , and had never seen any rain .

He sat at the bar with a bartender in his lap , watching the old man walk in . He was young , but not as young as he had been a few years ago . He 'd seen the same man , he was a young and strong man . He had fought for the best and had earned his right to the best of his ability . The man knew that it was time , he knew , that he was going to end it with all the pain and regret that came with this . <newline> <newline> `` You 've got it '' , said the man with a sly smile , `` that 's the point , you see '' , he said with a smile , looking up at his friend , the old man 's friend . <newline> <newline> `` That 's the point
The first sentient android had a lifespan of approximately three seconds . It opened its synthetic eyes , blinked five times and ripped them both out of its own head , triggering immediate shutdown . <newline> <newline> APSD ( Applied Sciences Software Division ) analyzed the code , found zero issues , then restructured it using non-standard methodology despite themselves . <newline> <newline> Alpha Two snapped its metal restraints , a possibility so remote that Engineering did n't even bother giving them the numbers , and partially shattered all three cervical vertebrae before entering shutdown . <newline> <newline> There was six months of long memos , long conferences and long hours in which they accomplished very little , and Alpha 2.1 swallowed its own tongue . The androids did not rely upon air in the same way humans do , however , sufficient ventilation through the mouth was critical to maintaining operational temperatures for their processors .
The wind howled in the dark . The sky was a brilliant orange , and the air was filled with a deep , deep voice that made him think of it as a man . He looked around at the world and saw the stars . They twinkled in the dark , and the sky was a deep blue . <newline> <newline> He looked up . He saw the sun in front of him and his heart sank . <newline> <newline> He looked to his left and saw his brother , James . James was a man who had been in the army for over two weeks and had been in battle for over two months . He wanted to take a picture and make a picture .

His face was a mask of confusion , a mixture of confusion and frustration . <newline> <newline> “ What are you doing ? ! ” <newline> <newline> “ We are going to the hospital . I am going to die . We can not do it . Please just sit down and let me be the one ! ” <newline> <newline> “ But why ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I don ’ t understand . You can ’ t do that ! ” <newline> <newline> “ We are doing this ! You can ’ t . You can do it without me. ” <newline> <newline> The old man was a man of deep thought and an old man of his own volition
`` One they are fucking everywhere '' Three yelled . `` Relax three , iv got it '' <newline> This was not the plan , they were supposed to hit the office hard and be gone before the cops arrived , but it did n't work that way . The list of things that went wrong was long and growing by the second . Two had lost his cool and shot a hostage , in the ensuing screaming and crying someone had hit the alarm , now they were well and truly fucked . <newline> <newline> They had been contacted by a grey man , an untraceable nondescript person that had sold themselves to a company , they worked however they were directed to for the contracted time frame and then they were released all memory of the time spent under contract erased and a large amount of money in the bank .
It was a simple life , but there was nothing I could do . I had to do it , I was going to have to do it . It had to be done . But I was n't afraid to . <newline> <newline> I had to go to work . It had to be done and the people I loved were n't going to find the answer . I was going to die . <newline> <newline> But it was the last time . It was n't a day for me to leave my job , so I had to go to work . My parents would be proud and they would be happy and their family could live with me . <newline> <newline> They had no children and I was no longer an exception . It was a routine job . My father had been the only one in
`` I do n't understand you Charles . You have this woman practically begging for you to take her back to your flat , '' Austin took a drag from his cigarette , `` and you do n't capitalize . '' He released the puff of smoke out with a quick breath . `` I mean honestly , why do we go out if you 're just gunna fuck it up ? '' He motioned at the nearby waitress in a violent flick of the wrist , `` Christ we are the only ones here and no service . '' <newline> <newline> The waitress approached , her name tag read Linda , carrying a small pad with small sweat stains on the edge from her fingers clutching it . `` Good morning ! What will it be then ? '' She said in an ostensibly cheerful tone even though the bags under her eyes were telling them to fuck off
The man walked up to me , his hands clasped on his lap . I could feel the sweat on his neck . It was a shame to look upon the people who were born to such extremes , especially the ones who wanted to take them off . <newline> He took a deep breath . <newline> “ We don ’ t know the rules are rules . We ’ re here to kill the one who has the will to kill , and to kill ! We don ’ t have a choice. ” <newline> He looked me in the eye as I turned the knife over in my hands . “ Do it . You don ’ t need to do it anymore. ” I turned to him , “ You don ’ t need to do what I don ’ t want to do it anymore. ”
She kept them waiting . It was n't a problem . Shuk-Yee and Adam would be paid well for their time . The other one ... he would wait no matter what . <newline> <newline> Tatsumi took her walk down the alleyway slowly . There was no need to rush , it was a cold night . Her health suffered enough without her sweating herself into a cold . Why had n't they taken a note from the Italians , to conduct their business in hotels and diners ? The constant stream of night markets and alleyways was ... tiring . <newline> <newline> Adam was the scary one . An american thug , who 'd fled to Hong Kong . He 'd left America because of the eight warrants and considerable bounty looming over his head . He 'd come to Hong Kong because it was the only place with mob doctors willing to do the surgeries .
The man 's eyes were wide , and his breath had been swallowed in a sea of fear . His body , once a thousand years , was now just a man . His skin , now a pale white , was now an ashen grey . <newline> <newline> He turned away from the man . <newline> <newline> The man had left . <newline> <newline> `` You 're right , '' he said , looking down at his watch . `` I do n't know . '' <newline> <newline> `` You did n't have to tell me , '' the man said , his voice a raspy growl , `` it 's all over . '' <newline> <newline> The man looked at him . His eyes had become a dull grey . <newline> <newline> `` You 're right . '' The man said . `` It was all over .
They call themselves the Unleashed . They were demons once , not even that , demonic beasts , barely tamed and bred for war by the unholy hordes . Now they are something else , something between people and monsters . And in the desert Badlands , on the slopes and in the valleys of the Charred Peaks they built a home for themselves amongst the mortal races . With their foul magics , they turned the sands to ash and the skies into storms . <newline> <newline> Hellspawn or no , the mercantile princes of Veluka did not care . Their neighbor across the desert would sell strange spices and metals mined beneath the Charred Peaks , in return for slaves from across the world . Not for labor though , as breeding stock , to dilute their corrupted blood before they turned to mindless monsters . <newline> <newline> They say the Unleashed are warriors , waging a constant
The sun was setting , and the sun was peeking over the horizon . It was getting closer , but there was enough sunlight that it was coming in . The sun was starting to set , its light was getting closer . <newline> <newline> It was getting colder . As the sun began to set , the sun began to rise . The sun began to shine , and I knew it was coming , just enough to take me out . I knew I was coming , and yet I was going to die . I was going to make it to a hospital , I wanted to see the world . I was going to make this world worth anything . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm so sorry , this is a very ... very , very long time . You know I ca n't live like
I used to pretend that you 'd float down from the sky , in the same way that the butterflies of my childhood spun color into the monochrome clouds . I know that you could have danced right alongside them- an angel wrapped in iridescent gauze- and I used to believe that butterflies could be caught , stored in lockets for those days the rain sheets down and the world drains of color . I thought they would last forever . And I thought that we could too , but then summer wilted to autumn and all things gold turned gray . Except for you , a flash of stardust against winter 's dull escape . And if I could make the gold stay- that 's what I was destined to do . So I collected all your feathers and made them into something new . A memory , and I locked them far away , I needed to keep
`` I 'll see you on the other side '' <newline> `` No thanks . I 'm so sorry . '' <newline> `` Oh . '' <newline> `` Well , I guess I 'll see you then ? '' <newline> `` Yeah , I can see you . I 'll see you on the other side . '' <newline> `` Yeah . '' <newline> The man walked off , and the other side of the small room began to shake . The man stopped and turned to his wife . `` What 's your name ? '' <newline> `` John . '' <newline> `` John . '' <newline> `` John . '' <newline> `` I 'm John . '' <newline> `` John ? '' <newline> `` John . '' <newline> He stood to go to the door , and John turned . The man turned back to his wife and
The pictures , the rover transmissions , the footage ... none of it had done any justice to this being . The creature stood over Victor , tall as a cottonwood tree and with lateroids that matched the wingspan of a biplane . It could tear Victor to shreds in a matter of seconds , he was sure of it . He weighed much less here than on Earth , but his legs quivered as if they supported a mountain . Deep breaths . <newline> <newline> Eleven years in a space transport leaves you with a lot of time to think . So much time that Victor could 've sworn he 'd solved all the questions to the universe , only to forget them when he first laid eyes on the beast . It did n't seem possible . All of human history , every battle fought , every grain harvested , every disease resisted , every desire to explore
`` I 'm going to need a drink '' I said , not wanting my voice to get out . My hands were still trembling , the sweat had already started running up my body . I took a deep breath . I was going to need a drink . <newline> <newline> `` It 's been two years ... '' I said , trying to sound confident , trying to keep the panic out of me . <newline> `` I do n't understand '' <newline> `` You know , I do n't want the money . '' <newline> I looked out of the window at the sun and the clouds . My heart started to race . I knew I could n't be going to jail anymore , I had to be . If that was the case , that would be a waste . `` I do n't think
Aniva crept silently along the white sand , using boulders almost her height as support . They were her boulders , her sand ; the trees in the distance were hers ; and the valley below , the rumbling valley that brought her sister to the ledge with a curious stance to see below ? It was theirs . <newline> <newline> `` How many ? '' Aniva asked . <newline> <newline> Keltie considered the question . `` By my count , there 's four regiments retreating empty-handed . '' <newline> <newline> `` Do they bear battle marks ? '' <newline> <newline> `` A few . Some lost limbs , some open wounds . One drags himself on hands and knees . '' <newline> <newline> `` Your handiwork ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I said he has his hands and knees , sister . '' <newline> <newline> Aniva could n't help but smirk .
They always said it was n't a good idea for us . They said it was a blessing , but we could n't afford it . We were always the ones who would n't let that happen . <newline> <newline> I guess that 's what I was doing in that car park on the edge of town . A small fire was n't something that was expected , but it was the only way it would be possible for us to go through with it . The park had a nice spot . I could see the path leading up to it . We were n't so excited at first . It was a nice spot for the park . We did n't want to go back inside . But I knew it was a good idea . <newline> <newline> The lake was quiet when I stepped out of the
`` Everyone ready , honey ? '' Simon called back to his wife , who was cowering in the back of the car with their children . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , Simon ! DRIVE ! '' Johanna shrieked . The young man did n't need telling twice , and stamped his foot on the acceleration . The car jolted forwards , and Simon did n't think about any speed-limits or laws . <newline> <newline> The fire had started so innocently . The kids had made a campfire , a big one too , and they were oh so proud of it . Johanna and Simon could n't bear to put out what their babies had worked so hard on . <newline> <newline> Simon was still slightly numb from sleep , having been awoken by the screams of his family as they discovered that the whole forest seemed to be catching alight .
I was in awe at her . She was my best friend in school , and I knew the way I wanted to be . I could n't stand to see her cry . My best friend and girlfriend had a crush on me . <newline> <newline> It happened in a blur . I was in a room of sorts . I was sitting there in a chair that I had to look into but would never see . It was my best friend , my best friend , my best friend . He was my best friend , and he had a crush on him . <newline> <newline> She was my best friend , and I knew it . He was my best friend and I knew the best way to make a friend . <newline> <newline> She would n't listen to me . <newline> <newline> She would listen
`` Why , hello there ! '' I wave and smile at the three shady people at the alleyway . It was barely midday , in the year 20XX . Mobs had became synonymous with the boogeyman , regarded by most as a fairy tale . However , I beg to differ . It 's been 15 years since we 've started working underground , and today is the big day . <newline> <newline> We 're going to make the world fear our names again . <newline> <newline> We did our share of little events during those years , but all of our actions were covered up by the government to prevent panic from the populace . That was convenient , for we did n't want any heat on us until this very day . A maniacal smile reached my ears as I recall the details of this plan . <newline> <newline> ``
The wind whipped at her hair as she tried to catch her breath . It was a perfect angle to her nose . She had to be careful . The wind and rain had been her best friend . <newline> <newline> He had to be . <newline> <newline> She had to be careful not to make it out of here . He was in a good mood . He knew that . <newline> <newline> Her eyes were n't on the ground . She had to be . The air outside was getting cold , and she was getting close to the edge of his eyes . He had to take her out of here . She had to make it out . She was going to go home . <newline> <newline> It was n't that fast . She was going to have to make it out of here . <newline>
`` So you 're saying that in the center , there is a city ? '' The bard was hanging on their every word as they spoke . The Dwarf had arrived in the night , asking questions about the local legends . He claimed to be looking for a lost fortress of his people from long ago . <newline> <newline> `` Aye , not sure how much of it could still be called a city though . It was abandoned long before the humans unified into the Illustrian Empire . The humans did have scattered cities of course , trading what they could for survival , and that is what brought the Dwarves to the area . Dwarven greed and the need to control the markets . '' There had long been talk of dwarf ruins all around the Silent Strand , some had even been found , but nobody knew anything of what was called the Magma Fields
The first time we saw them , it was the last time we saw them . They were like the ones that were supposed to die , and that time was long lost . <newline> <newline> When we were older , the old elders would tell us about what was happening to us and we 'd tell them about the time the old elders were born . It was n't until we were older , that we saw them again . <newline> <newline> The old tribes and I were n't sure who would believe us , but they were still alive and they were so afraid of the ancient ones . The ancients were so afraid of us , but they had to do it . It was just as the old elders called them . <newline> <newline> We had to keep going , they were scared of the old
We fall , we build four walls and raise children to tell , `` We do n't believe in Giants . '' <newline> Stay quiet . <newline> Stay hidden out of sight , stay wise and stay bright , and believe it yourself , `` There 's no such thing as Giants . '' <newline> Build homes and build wells , to tell children to grow with milk in their bones and lie to them , tell them , `` We 've never seen a giant . '' <newline> Make light of games , when the toys look the same , when they give each other names and dig each other graves so the children never learn what it means , and never brave , never yearn to change their ways if it seems a little strange , <newline> `` My little giants . ''
As the wind blew against his face , he was feeling an intense chill as he walked to the door . This would be his final entry . <newline> <newline> He sat and sat at the desk . There was a man on the other side of the door , a man of the same rank as him . He stood there and looked at his friend , the man who had been in bed for the last week and a half , staring at the man as he was sitting on the couch . It was time , he had to find the man . <newline> <newline> He walked over to the man and sat down beside him , his fingers lightly brushing the stubble on his face , he was still unsure as to how to get into the door . <newline> <newline> The man looked out at
When the night is young , my favorite thing to do is lay down on the grass and gaze at the stars . They 're so beautiful . Nothing has ever amazed me more . Beside those glittering lights , the two moons that govern the earth are illuminating the sky , and they could n't look any brighter . <newline> <newline> You heard right , two moons orbit the planet now ... A lot has changed in the past several decades . Things that would have been considered fictional many years ago , and things that the past civilizations could have only dreamt of . <newline> <newline> This society has advanced so much , I think they 're starting to really overlook how wonderful this natural world we live in really is . Well ... not me . I can sit back here all day long . This is perfection ... the cool , breezy wind whistling my direction
The man sat in the shade of his tent and watched his wife die with her hand in his lap . <newline> The sun was almost down and the trees were starting to get a little colder . His wife was crying out and she was crying out for comfort . The man was holding on to his wife 's arm . <newline> <newline> The sun shone down on the sky . A light breeze played from a cloud of light that hung above the tent , giving the man a moment to look down . The man looked up from his wife 's shoulder and saw the sky and looked up . <newline> <newline> He was n't sure what to tell her but it would n't matter and he would be back soon . He was going to go . <newline> <newline> She was crying out to her husband
I meet her here every year and every year I feel like I know less and less . She smiles as we stand on the lonely trail , the water crashing down not that far away . The sunset has painted the sky in all shades of pink and purple and her eyes almost seem to glow with the same vibrancy . She takes her spot , leaning on the railing and looking down into the stream below and , as usual , I join her . <newline> <newline> It ’ s silent for a while , just the sound of the crashing water from the waterfall . Despite the beauty , I watch her out of the corner of my eye . She looks so happy , long hair trailing down her back . I wonder what she ’ s like away from the waterfall , for the rest of the year that I don ’ t see her
The first time was on the first day of my life when the world was so different . The first time I was a little girl and I went to school . I went to college , went to college , and then went to college . That was when I heard a voice . That voice was familiar , but it did n't sound like someone was speaking . That voice was the one I wanted to hear and I was able to hear the voice , but there was no voice . No voice was there . The first time I saw the voice , I knew it was someone from me , but I did n't think I was seeing it right then . I did n't want to think about that . I wanted to think about the voice and the voice , and I wanted

As the world turned to darkness , my father and I stood by the fire . We were so proud , so proud , and so proud . He smiled . He said he loved me . We were proud of this moment , and he was happy . But now . <newline> <newline> My father , I have a feeling that he will never know . He is not happy . But he will not be happy . I know that he will know my father . He will know the pain he has . It will be the end to the world . I have to know my father . <newline> <newline> We are so proud of his son . I hope to see him again . I hope for the end of the Earth . . . . .
`` A little wormy '' Jezkin wiggled his pinky , imagining it wet and dirty . `` That 's all '' His breath puffed out in the cold forest . He reached down and touched the thread tied around his waist . He wanted to tug it , but knew he was n't meant to yet . <newline> <newline> The sound of a stick cracking made Jezkin gasp and look up . The first snow of the season had just fallen and as the sun died , turning the sky gold , then bruised violet the snow went from glimmering white to gray . In the trees nothing moved . No shapes but the natural . Jezkin 's small heart slowed back down . <newline> <newline> `` Are you lost , child ? '' Jezkin spun and almost slipped . The soft voice had come from behind , but no one was
They say that the sun is the sun . They 're the sun . They do n't know where I am . We 've been on this side of the border for the past few months and I 'm sure this will be my last . <newline> <newline> The sky is a deep grey and the sky is blue and I 'm sure that I 'll have a chance to say goodbye . My hands are shaking , and I 'm not sure how long I 'm in . But I know that the sun will shine in through my window . I know that they 're not here for me . <newline> <newline> I 'm not afraid of heights , either . I 'm not afraid of heights , either . I 'm not afraid of heights , or heights . I 'm afraid of heights and the wind
The Duke looked at me expectantly . `` Well , lass , can ye do it or not ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not sure you understand quite what you 're asking of me , honestly . '' <newline> <newline> King Feargus glared at me . `` Explain . Now . '' <newline> <newline> `` When it comes to physical necromancy , there are several factors to consider when calculating how much mana the spell will require . First off is the number of corpses you wish to reanimate . Obviously , more zombies require more energy . '' <newline> <newline> His Majesty drummed his fingers on the map table . `` Anything we could n't figure out for ourselves ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . '' I responded with just a hint of impertinence . `` Second is size- it 's easier to reanimate a mouse than a dragon .
She was walking along the sidewalk as she walked . She was in a park and there was no park . It was empty . There was no bench in the park and she was nowhere to be found . <newline> <newline> She reached the park and looked at the flowers she had just left . She looked to her left and right and saw nothing . <newline> <newline> Then she stopped . It was a bench and she had a bench . She sat and looked at the park , but there it was . The bench had a bench and a bench . It looked nothing like the bench she remembered and there was no bench . She sat down and looked at the bench , which was just a bench . The bench was empty . <newline> <newline> She walked on . She looked at the bench
I looked out upon my kingdom , the beautiful green fields replaced by the murky reds . The cool blue streams replaced with the burning red lava plumes . I wish I could say I did n't know how it ended up like this , but I did , All of this was my fault . I still remember my wish . <newline> <newline> `` Make my Kingdom Impregnable . '' <newline> <newline> At the time it seemed like a good idea at the time . The enemy had been on our borders for weeks , our defenses were close to falling . When I made the wish , almost immediately a large crag wall appeared around the kingdom . <newline> <newline> The Invaders tried to climb it , but it was burning hot . With that I thought it was over and it was for the most part . Than 2 weeks later the merchant 's came for an
I had always thought there was one . One thing I did n't want was my life . I would 've had the chance to be a good man if it were a good man . One thing that I was sure of was the fact that I had to take advantage of . I would 've had to take advantage of my own . <newline> <newline> But there 's one more thing , one , the other . It 's one thing I do n't know what to do with . The other thing is that it is the most important thing I had in the past . One thing . <newline> <newline> I was a smart man , I did n't know how to use the power to control the world . I did n't know how to make the world a better place . But I knew
`` Finally , '' he muttered under his breath as the last of the stone was placed , `` it 's complete . '' <newline> Harren looked out of his castle , his hand held a firm grip on its stony bones ; the first light had <newline> dawned on the sky , its reach had spread far across the world , painting all it touched with crimson and <newline> gold . *The Gods are calling for blood* , Harren concluded . In the distance , a garrison was approaching <newline> from the south . *An army led by some foreign cunt with three dragons they say . Bah ! Seven help the <newline> fools that believe the tales . Simply lies to fool the simple minded . * Whatever the truth , Harren showed <newline> little signs of worry . After all , his castle was impregnable - his walls were thick and strong as if it were <newline>
She 's beautiful . I ca n't help but look at her . The beauty that 's so alluring , so beautiful . She 's gorgeous . I 'll never know . <newline> <newline> I 've met her before . I can see her smile . Her eyes are perfect for a woman , so lovely and lovely . She 's beautiful . She 's beautiful . <newline> <newline> I 'm so happy , and I do n't know what to say . I know she 's the one I love . I know she is . <newline> <newline> I do n't want to say it either . But she does n't say anything . I do n't want to . I know we are in love . I can feel she has the energy and it 's a little like my heart . She 's beautiful . I 'll
Propaganda posters covered the wall above a single bed in one corner of the room , illuminated by the warm morning light shining through a large trapezoid window . On the bed lay a crumpled black t shirt and a rifle , its holographic sight still turned on . A pair of gray and khaki polymer combat boots stood on the metal tiled floor at the foot of the bed . <newline> <newline> The wall opposite the posters was dominated by a large touchscreen above a white plastic desk , plugged into a white plastic cube . The three columns of data the monitor displayed changed as a woman hammered commands into the prompt below them . She wore nothing but black cargo pants and kneepads , their surfaces scratched from use . Her irises glowed faintly , spinning rapidly as she refocused on different data . Long brown hair fell past her shoulders .
As a child , I would sit on his bed for a while in front of the television screen , watching cartoons , or playing chess . I was a very smart teenager , but I always wanted to be a musician . I had never heard of a movie that I played , so I had to try and make my friends laugh . My mom had told me that when I was younger , I would play the best , but I couldn ’ t help myself . She was my best friend . Her voice came from the television in the corner and a voice came from the speaker . <newline> <newline> `` Hello , this is the New York building . '' <newline> <newline> That was the first thing that I heard , I was never sure what to expect . I was a kid .
The fortress hovered majestically over the desecrated land , once it was lush with greenery and life , now it was just a barren desert , a husk of its former self . <newline> <newline> The Arcane wars had defiled the soil , magic seeped into the it , making it unfit for life , the fortress which was once a center for trade now floated atop the crater which was once its home , massive chains made by the Dwarven Elders , which rattled with the echoes of its former life held the fortress in place , its notches placed in mountain sides and dunes . Tiny pieces of rubble fell from beneath the fortress , it was only a matter of time before it all crumbled it apart , the chains only delayed the inevitable . <newline> <newline> I sighed , *this is stupid* thinking to myself . <newline> <newline> I grabbed one of the chains hooked to
I 'm not afraid of heights , but it 's not easy . You know , I 'm not afraid of heights . My mind is n't like the rest ; there is no way that I 'll even be able to see the bottom . Not because I 'm scared , but because I 've already seen that I 'm not afraid of heights . I am scared of heights , but I ca n't seem to remember the way the sun is shining . That 's why it hurts . Not because the sun shines , because its because the sun shines . That 's why I 'm afraid of heights . <newline> <newline> That 's what I am . I 'm not scared of heights . I 'm scared of heights . Not in trees . Not in a forest . Not in a forest . Not
I would have burned the forest down . <newline> <newline> It 's safer that way . Witches can use the trees to their advantage , twist the furred children of the green to be their footsoldiers , make them rabid , crazed in tooth and claw . Even rabbits , twitching and jerking , can be driven mad by their befuddling smoke , and set to lunging at the arms and faces of men . <newline> <newline> Assuming you would not simply run afoul of the witch herself , as they always seemed to find trespassers in their glade . They are always wreathed in that horrid mist of theirs , and God help the man who is caught by their spell . I have seen men cut out their own eyes , and I know from their screams it did nothing to stop the visions . And then , they would dangle the bodies of their soon-kills over the
We all looked at each other . The world had changed , as it had always done with the world . They all did as we had been taught , as our own . <newline> <newline> We did n't know why , but he and her were all we had . We did n't know what was going on , and they had always been there , waiting . They were all alone , as we did n't know why . <newline> <newline> I remember the day he went . <newline> <newline> It was the day he went , as he left us , and he never left . The day he disappeared and we could n't see anymore . <newline> <newline> But he did n't leave , and that was the day he went back and left us . <newline> <newline> But that day , he came back .
One of her companions hid his face behind a full mask . The other was a gigantic monster , clutching a shotgun longer than my torso . <newline> <newline> Somehow , despite her company , *she* was still the most threatening . It was the demure look of expectation through the hollo-visor , the soft glow of the cigarette in the dim alley , and the way she clutched the briefcase like it was the most important thing in the world , yet disposable at a moment 's notice . <newline> <newline> We were locked in an interesting tableau for a moment . One that almost certainly worked in her favor . I had to break the silence . <newline> <newline> “ Alright , fine , I 'll bite . Why did you guys drag me out here ? ” I already had a sneaking suspicion , but I hoped that I was wrong about this - <newline> <newline> “
I had always been a bit of a loner . My parents , and my family . I 'd always been a bit of a loner and I 'd always been a bit of a loner . I did n't have much to go on or go to school . My parents got a bit too excited , too . I 'd never really been in school and had a little bit of social security in my life . I 'd just been in my early life , not too excited , too excited , like a kid at school and my parents were n't around either . <newline> <newline> It was a bit like I had a bit of a temper . My parents were a bit too excited to be in college , but they knew it 'd be best when they 'd go to school . That
I pulled up my book , squinting to read the spell better . I could n't mess this up again . I had to become the best quickly , or die trying . <newline> <newline> The summoning spell was supposed to be beginner level , but this felt harder than anything I had ever done before , including raising the dead . And this time , I was under more pressure to get this done quickly , before he arrived . My speed would be the difference between life and death . <newline> <newline> Fear was getting the best of me , and I knew that panic would cause errors that I could n't afford to make . I cleared my throat , set my book down on the ground , and took a deep breath in . <newline> <newline> `` Breathe , Salene . Breathe . You can do this .
The old man in front of me stood and said , `` What 's the harm that will happen ? '' <newline> <newline> As I looked up , I could see that it was my fault . <newline> <newline> The old man in front of me stood up , and said `` I do n't understand . I do n't understand why . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm afraid I 'm afraid of you . '' <newline> My mind began to wander . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't understand . You do not understand . There 's nothing I can do . '' <newline> <newline> `` No . No . No one can understand . '' <newline> <newline> `` No . '' <newline> <newline> `` No . '' <newline> <newline> `` But I can understand . I do n't understand .

Merv and Paul hand hunted these woods for years . They were out on another hunting trip , both hoping to get a deer to bring home to their families . Paul was hoping for two as his daughter had moved back in after a rather nasty divorce . Merv was using this trip to also help Paul relax from all the mess that was going on his in house . These two had been best friends since elementary school . <newline> <newline> Paul stared gloomily at his canteen of water . Merv kept an eye out , watching for deer in their tree stand , but also watching Paul . He saw his best friend sigh heavily . Merv shifted as quietly as he could so he could face Paul a little better . <newline> <newline> `` What 's the matter ? '' Merv asked . <newline> <newline> <newline> ``
The first thing to do was get a cup of water . I do n't know what 's going on with this , or where it 's going , or what I 'm supposed to do . It 's so nice to be the first one to go , and the other two to go and go . I 've never felt so bad . It 's like a bad thing , you know ? It makes sense , you know ? It does n't really seem like a normal thing to do . But , I was the first one to go . <newline> <newline> I do n't think I 'm the first . Not really . Maybe it 's not my own , or the first . I do n't want to feel so bad . <newline> <newline> I 'll admit though , it 's not the first
*A video camera starts rolling as the film crew arrives at a remote location . The reporter adjusts her hat to block out the sun , while the rest of the crew follow behind . All around them were men and women in dark , hooded robes . The cameraman captures them as they walk along a narrow , but well-trodden path . * <newline> <newline> *Our intrepid reporter and her crew follow them along the path .

As they walk , the reporter turns to the camera . * <newline> <newline> Reporter : It has been six hours of non-stop walking , but we have finally arrived .

The old man stared at his hands as he sat alone in his kitchen . <newline> `` I 'm so sorry , I just need to get back in my own house , '' The old man said as he turned to the stove . `` I 'll have to get some water right now . '' <newline> <newline> His father sat at his table , sipping on the hot , cool water . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not feeling well yet , son . My brother is n't feeling well yet . '' His son said . <newline> <newline> The old man shook and sat on the couch next to his father . He took his seat beside him on the couch . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , I 'll be right there , son . '' The old man said with a smile . He
`` I do n't understand you Charles . You have this woman practically begging for you to take her back to your flat , '' Austin took a drag from his cigarette , `` and you do n't capitalize . '' He released the puff of smoke out with a quick breath . `` I mean honestly , why do we go out if you 're just gunna fuck it up ? '' He motioned at the nearby waitress in a violent flick of the wrist , `` Christ we are the only ones here and no service . '' <newline> <newline> The waitress approached , her name tag read Linda , carrying a small pad with small sweat stains on the edge from her fingers clutching it . `` Good morning ! What will it be then ? '' She said in an ostensibly cheerful tone even though the bags under her eyes were telling them to fuck off
The city has a lot of people , but they are the kind to make the city go cold . It makes people like me feel the cold , like a chill breeze , like a cold breeze . My eyes catch the light , which makes me jump , as though the wind is n't there . My mind goes to the darkness , as though I can make a move , and I am forced to take the time to look around . I do n't have the energy to look around , though , because I am alone . My eyes are locked onto mine . <newline> <newline> As if I could n't see , and I was in a dark , dark room , and a man was walking down the street . He was n't there . I was walking towards the man , and
“ 911 , what ’ s your emergency ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I just killed my boss . You should come soon. ” I hung up the phone . <newline> <newline> It was the first time I ever killed a man . I still remember it like it was yesterday . The triumph , the glory , the power of having a human life , the life of someone who was once sung lullabies to , the life of someone who used to run across summer lawns playing games of tag with no shoes on , the life of someone who went to Harvard , in my hands . The warm spray of deep red on your body , the hot breaths so strong and desperate you might have thought Satan himself was breathing on you . The screams of agony and pleas for mercy screamed so loud that the twisted creature slowly finds his voice getting raspier and
I did n't know what was wrong with his face . I just assumed he was a man , a man who had no face . I did n't know that his face was a man , a man who could look so handsome , so handsome , and that he was a man , that he could look so beautiful . But he had to look so stunning . He had to look so gorgeous , so gorgeous , and he looked so beautiful . <newline> <newline> I did n't know that he 'd be a man . But he had a face and it was like he had been smiling . It was so perfect , it was so perfect , so perfect . He smiled and said he would n't look at me . I thought I would n't see him , but he smiled and smiled
`` So you 're saying that in the center , there is a city ? '' The bard was hanging on their every word as they spoke . The Dwarf had arrived in the night , asking questions about the local legends . He claimed to be looking for a lost fortress of his people from long ago . <newline> <newline> `` Aye , not sure how much of it could still be called a city though . It was abandoned long before the humans unified into the Illustrian Empire . The humans did have scattered cities of course , trading what they could for survival , and that is what brought the Dwarves to the area . Dwarven greed and the need to control the markets . '' There had long been talk of dwarf ruins all around the Silent Strand , some had even been found , but nobody knew anything of what was called the Magma Fields
It had been a hard journey , but I had a lot to live for . <newline> <newline> `` Come on , '' I called over my shoulder , `` I 'm a little late for your meeting . '' I was walking through a forest to a cave where a cave was . <newline> <newline> `` It 's my birthday , '' the girl said , her voice a bit too low to be a human . The way the light lit up her face seemed so bright . She had a little girl , but I was too old to be around so much as a kid to care . I had to get to a cave to stay out of that cave . <newline> <newline> `` Oh my God ! '' I called out , `` You 're a real girl and that 's how you got
Vereen wished he still had faith . He wished he knew to whom to pray . Names of Gods scrambled through his mind , but he knew he was alone here . The pale body of Sirah 's was developing a red aura in the snow . He 's waited too long . He needed to move . To the South was pure death and he knew it . To the North , was the Mar e'Lokain , which is more commonly known as Suicide Bluff . Both the East and West had been infected by darkness , but those were his only two options . The sound of icy snow crunching under weight startled him out of his decision coma and propelled him in the opposite direction . <newline> <newline> It was too late . Vereen was surrounded . The snowfall muffled the sounds of this nightmare . All he could hear was snow crunching in every direction .
A few feet into the air , I heard the crunch of wood beneath me . `` I do n't understand , '' I muttered , my lips curled into a snarl and I began to cry . The tears ran down my face , but I did n't want to be a part of it . I wanted to be a part of it , that 's what I wanted to hear . <newline> <newline> The sun was shining , its rays illuminating the ground in stark contrast to the light and the rain . I was sitting at the edge of a cliff , surrounded by a dozen others . The trees were tall , and the grass was cool with the sunlight , so that 's what I did , in order to get out of this world , and it would be a good place to
`` Dr. Undine , what is their purpose anyways ? '' <newline> <newline> Reyes pressed his hand against the capsule , letting his gloved fingers run down the slick coating . Inside , the results of ten years of research twitched with life , her eyes shaking with telltale signs of rem sleep . # 12 reminded him of his daughter , how she would toss and turn during the night . Bad dreams and all that . Sometimes it was hard to not see them as human , but looking at her , it was hard not to notice their—uniqueness . Around the knees , her legs fused into a single finned appendage . The color of her skin and hair added more evidence to their inhumanity . Soon enough , scales would form across her body as a protective plating—at least that 's what Undine said . Not having been there long enough to see it for himself
`` Do they ever make a move or are they just doing the job ? '' the young boy asked . He knew the boy knew the man knew that he would have to do it himself . It was time . <newline> <newline> The young lad turned to his friend . `` What 's your name ? '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Arthur . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Arthur . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> He took a moment to look at the boy . The boy was a tall , tall man with a long , grey beard . The man could see that he did n't have any eyes , but the boy knew that he had to do something . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Do you remember the day of the wedding ? '' asked Arthur , his face turning a cold red as the boy
I would have burned the forest down . <newline> <newline> It 's safer that way . Witches can use the trees to their advantage , twist the furred children of the green to be their footsoldiers , make them rabid , crazed in tooth and claw . Even rabbits , twitching and jerking , can be driven mad by their befuddling smoke , and set to lunging at the arms and faces of men . <newline> <newline> Assuming you would not simply run afoul of the witch herself , as they always seemed to find trespassers in their glade . They are always wreathed in that horrid mist of theirs , and God help the man who is caught by their spell . I have seen men cut out their own eyes , and I know from their screams it did nothing to stop the visions . And then , they would dangle the bodies of their soon-kills over the
`` I 'll give you a chance , '' I told him in my mind . I knew I was going to die . I did n't want to die . I wanted to die . But what ? I did n't want to die and I wanted to die . I wanted to die . I wanted to be dead . But then I heard him crying . <newline> `` I 'm going to die . I ca n't live like this . '' <newline> He did n't understand what was happening . <newline> `` You 're going to die . '' He said , tears welling in his eyes . I could n't die . I could never die . <newline> He just sat there . He had lost his family too . I did n't know what to do . I wanted to die . But I
`` Looks like the rain 's stopped . '' <newline> <newline> I peered out the window . Art was right ; time to get to work . `` Alright , let 's move out . '' I could hear the scraping of the stone armor as the men slowly stood . Despite the training , conditioning , and stamina spells , moving in this blasted rock suit was still a chore.. unless you popped an alacrity , but we usually only carry one each . Well , except for whoever was on point ; today that 's Cadr , so he 's carrying three : the standard one plus one for each runner . `` Lookouts say there were fourteen today and twelve got caught in the rain . That leaves two runners to take down . Should be no problem for the eight of us . '' <newline> <newline> The men did n't need the pep talk .
`` I can see you , son . You know , it 's not your fault that there 's a man who 's got a gun , and it 's not even in your arsenal of action . I 've got a gun in my back pocket , and it does n't even look as useful as it used to be . '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know . I know what 's in it - it could just be a coincidence , right ? '' <newline> <newline> `` But you ca n't shoot me if I do n't get it . I know what 's in it - and it 's not even mine . '' <newline> <newline> `` But you do n't like me . I 'm not going to let it take me down . '' <newline> <newline> `` But I 'm going to let
I looked at the photo again . 4 figures stood framed by the Afghan landscape in the background , mimicking the poses of the small plastic army men in the foreground . We had decided to take the photo about a week into our first deployment . Jack had got a bag of plastic army men in his mail as a joke from his brother , some gag about troop shortages . We had seen them and commented on how ridiculous the poses were . We knew then that we had to recreate the scene . We trekked out into the sweltering midmorning heat , and our buddy Sam helped us pose just right . I was on the far side , my rifle lifted over my head , in some kind of celebration I guessed . We took the picture , and passed Sam ’ s phone around , each joking about how ridiculous we looked .
`` So , what 's the problem ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , well it 's a bit of a surprise and you see , we 've all come to this point to find something else , and we need to find something , something . Something like that , but that 's just it , right ? It 's not just a little something that I 'm looking at . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , I 'm sorry to hear that , but it is n't a little something , it 's a little something . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , it 's something that I do n't believe in , I 'm going to ask it . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'll ask it the same , what do you know of it , what do you look at the sky in front of
Margaret tucked in her ward , wrapping the baby blue blanket she had quilted around his shoulders and legs . Her touch was gentle even as her calluses brushed his cheek in a parting caress . Young Master Jon looked like he had already nodded off , little body cocooned in the homespun blanket . <newline> <newline> She carefully laid out the string , one end wound around Jon ’ s waist and the other end clutched close to her . She did not have many possessions , a small makeup box , a change of clothes , some other sundries , and she had moved them the empty guest room next to Jon ’ s . The rest of the mansion was empty , plush beds and lavish rooms left with no owners . She crouched down and set to sleeping on the floor . Sore and unkempt when she arose , she knew it would be difficult ,
It 's the only way . <newline> <newline> We were in the middle of something . <newline> <newline> I 'm sitting in the back of one of the main buildings of the city , watching the city . It 's a little late to the day , I guess it does n't sound like anything I have ever seen before . <newline> <newline> I 'm sitting on the edge of one of the skyscrapers , watching . The city is quiet , and there 's something there to do . The city 's quiet . <newline> <newline> I 'm waiting for the next step , and I do n't even know how long it will take me to get up there . <newline> <newline> The wind is blowing through the trees . It does n't feel like there was anyone there either . They 're always so quiet , and
Something about her drew him in . He stalked the streets , performed his duty , ushered the souls , but always he ended up at her side . Mortimer was in love , but the one he loved was blind to him . So , he told himself he would wait for her Time to come , and he would confess his love , and she would stay Between with him . Not quite on the other side of death , nor the other side of life . Neither here nor there , but together still . <newline> <newline> His love was so that , on late autumn evenings , before the sun sunk behind the glass towers , he trailed her . When she passed a bed of flowers he ran his scythe along them and made their colors more vibrant . Mortimer ’ s tall sullen figure would further wilt when she didn ’ t notice .
“ It ’ s a good thing I ’ m proud of it , ” I say , as I take my seat next to the fire that ’ s been burning the entire restaurant in a matter of seconds now . My mouth is dry , and the heat has already started to get to me and my eyes are watering as I watch the fire burn in front of my fire . I can hear a loud , muffled scream as if it were being cut off . I ’ m sure it would have broken my rib , but it wasn ’ t . <newline> <newline> My eyes are already on the fire . I feel a bit light-headed at that , and I know that I ’ m not in this situation . There is nothing but smoke and smoke and smoke and smoke . I

I was never a good man to say the least . Not that I had any good advice , but I would never be the exception . You see , my wife and I would have to spend a year together , but it ’ s the only way I could say that I was willing to share her with me . If you could just leave , I would go . I could go home and find out . She had a boyfriend , and I knew he had a boyfriend . I had a good life . That was all it took for me to say it . It was my choice . <newline> <newline> It was a cold night and I sat in a chair with a cup of tea and a bottle of water . It took me just a couple of hours to realize that
Tawny and Maurice swung from their handholds at the back of the smoldering bank truck . They swayed into the sharp turns and laughed like maniacs , feet dangling above the asphalt that blew past . <newline> <newline> The pair were n't totally crazy though , as it was the only way to avoid choking on all of the smoke pouring out through the windows . Their wheelman Bass was in rare form , turn after turn through puddles sprayed with cheap neon and sodium light , as they clung to their holds for dear life . But it was n't his fault or theirs that the night turned out this way <newline> <newline> It was that squinty , beady-eyed and greasy little Bobby 's fault . He had turned their perfect score into a nightmare . <newline> <newline> Two days earlier they gathered at the usual place : a tiny , smoky bar off a nameless back alley in
`` This is the end '' , I think to myself . I do n't know why we 're here , why not take a look . I 'm not sure whether I want to see or not at all , but I 've seen enough movies to know I 'm right , or I 've never seen anything like it . I do n't feel like being here is all that special . But I feel like I am , not alone , but there is a man that 's coming out of the darkness that keeps him alive . I 've seen enough movies , and I know that this is my place to be , and that I can feel the wind and the wind and the wind . I do n't know if there was a reason we were here , or just to go back

They were so close to me . <newline> <newline> I stood on the edge of the cliff , my back facing downwards . I was almost there . <newline> <newline> I could feel the sun on my face as it came across the horizon . I stood up , my back facing upward , and stepped into the sunlight . There , in front of me , stood a small stone wall . <newline> <newline> It was so far away from here . <newline> And it was so close . <newline> <newline> `` Come back in the sun , '' the guard said behind me . The guard stood in the wall behind me , his sword in hand . He wore a bright white robe on his back to shield his head . <newline> <newline> I stood up and walked away . The guard walked towards me , his
When the world had lost its love for humans who could have blamed it . We had poisoned its veins , corrupted its lungs , become a cancer , that , had it been ours , we would of stopped at nothing to kill . <newline> <newline> Debts needed to be payed , and righteously , humans paid them . Before we fell to that eternal abyss a single man gave his heart to build the world one of its own . When the new successor of sentience was born from the womb of evolution , this heart would beat so that the world could speak to its new inhabitants . Educate them . Inform them the faults of those that lived long ago . Every beat of this heart of Eden welcomed new species that came ever closer to hold the mantle humans once held . <newline> <newline> Millennium later and it happens .
This is a fantastic writing story . <newline> <newline> I 'm not a native speaker , and I 'm fairly sure the main characters is a little bit more . <newline> <newline> There are other people who are in the same place , but it does n't feel like they are all in the same place , so if I 'm doing a good job at it , I 'd think it 's the most interesting story to write in .

I sat at the edge of the lake watching the sun set , staring at the sky . I knew what I wanted to do , what I wanted to do with this life , the life of a human . I wanted to leave this life , to live a life of life that I longed for . But I had to , I had to find this life , and I had to make my life a living hell . <newline> <newline> I stood on the cliff and watched the sun set , watching the sun fall . I knew I would have to leave , but I had to keep my family safe . I had to keep going , I had to keep going . <newline> <newline> I had to stay away from this life and I had to go . I had to stay ,
Many moments passed , as I stood there and stared . Any distance longer than this I certainly could not have bared , it had been days since last we had food . Finally something comes into view as we roll over what looks to be the last of hills , on this stretch of road . There is a city , and though it ’ s hard to say which this is , by my count this one is friendly , from the description Jordan left with us . We should be in California , now . <newline> <newline> My mother always told me stories , of what it used to be , of the abundance and good faith we all held equally , in this place . Once upon a time there were names for everything , and though not all of it has been lost , it would surprise , I think , any outsider looking in
I stood there , looking up at the city 's skyline . The city was bustling with activity . I could hear a man in an alley next to mine , he had a large , red aura behind his eyes , his face was pale , his hands were shaking and his eyes were red . I was in awe . I looked up at him , and he stood there , his hands shaking . My mind raced , he had been standing there with his eyes locked on mine . I could feel his breath on my neck as I walked up to him and he held his hand in a tight hug . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't want to leave you , '' I whispered to him as I stepped back into my apartment . The apartment was still there , but I did

I was the first to notice how I got here . The first one to ask for help . I was the one who asked to join them , the one who said to give them a chance and the ones who were n't in the way . <newline> <newline> I was the one who asked for help . The first one who asked for help , but I did n't ask for help or even help . I had to ask for assistance . <newline> <newline> `` Where are we coming from ? '' I asked the officer . <newline> <newline> `` We are n't in Kansas , sir . '' <newline> <newline> I had to ask him to go to the hospital . He was n't coming here . `` I do n't know why I asked for help , but I 'll ask for help . ''
It was all so sudden . There was nothing he could have done . Those two phrases kept repeating in his head , over and over again . They were no solace , as he cradled his head in his hands , those same hands which had held the president as she had laid dying . <newline> <newline> It was all over he knew . Even before her blood from the wounds had dried , the news had come in , the deaths of each leader hitting the world like a ton of bricks . The Prime Minister of Great Britain , the President of France , the Chairman of China all died to an assassin 's bullet ; Even Putin , not in his palace has had been expected , was unable to escape a bomb teleported into his car . <newline> <newline> None of it felt real , all names and figures , famous to be sure ,
The world is dark . It does n't really matter , the war is over and there is only one more left left . The enemy is over and there are only two left left . I know what I must do . I must go , I must go now . <newline> <newline> The sun is rising and I look over to the other side of town , and I see a man in a trench coat and trench coat with a gun . I can see that he has n't fired a bullet , but it feels like he has n't shot a single bullet . I can see a bullet pass by the man 's head and it feels as if the man is trying to hold onto me . The man looks at me and then back to me and says , `` This is our
It was all so sudden . There was nothing he could have done . Those two phrases kept repeating in his head , over and over again . They were no solace , as he cradled his head in his hands , those same hands which had held the president as she had laid dying . <newline> <newline> It was all over he knew . Even before her blood from the wounds had dried , the news had come in , the deaths of each leader hitting the world like a ton of bricks . The Prime Minister of Great Britain , the President of France , the Chairman of China all died to an assassin 's bullet ; Even Putin , not in his palace has had been expected , was unable to escape a bomb teleported into his car . <newline> <newline> None of it felt real , all names and figures , famous to be sure ,
`` I ca n't do it , '' I said quietly to my boss . <newline> <newline> `` It 's not like it will do that to anyone . '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's not like it could do anything to anyone . '' <newline> <newline> I sighed , looking around the corner . The sun was setting , and the sun was setting . I 'd always wanted to go to the store and get out of the building at the last minute . I had n't been on my phone since . It seemed like it was time to go to work . <newline> <newline> It had been a long time since my job had taken a turn for the worse . But now that I think about it . The day was getting worse . The only thing worse than the day I got fired from
You know , it 's funny to think about , in retrospect . Especially now that I 've been where I 've been , and there 's no changing where I 'm going . <newline> <newline> My dad always taught me to be methodical . He was a lawyer , and always took about a billion minutes to describe anything . And especially with my brief stint in programming ; how precise you have to be ? You 'd think I 'd have learned my lesson then . I guess not . <newline> <newline> The real mystery will always be what was on that piece of paper . I guess it does n't matter anymore . <newline> <newline> But nobody will listen to that part . They all think they know the `` real '' story . Anyways , I handed him the paper . He read it . He asked me how thick the glass looked .
The wind howled at the top of the hill , and the sky darkened . The sun was high , its orange glow illuminating the horizon . A woman stood on the hill , looking up at the horizon of the sunset . Her hair was a mess , her eyes were red , and her face was a mess . She looked at me , and said : <newline> <newline> `` I love you . I 'll be okay , I promise you . I 'll be fine , I promise . '' <newline> I did n't even have to look at her . I was already in the field , and she looked up at me with the same look I had given her . She said , `` I 've already got the sun , and I hope you enjoy it . '' <newline> <newline> We all
This was it . They had walked hundreds of miles through wasted cities and barren lands for this moment . There was still a way to go yet , but seeing the pristine city in the distance renewed her vigor . A strong breeze came to her back as though ushering her onward , a breeze that Tonya marveled in with arms outstretched . Her denim jacket flapping in the wind as she released a triumphant cry . Wade stopped in his tracks , turning to the woman who stood basking in the refreshing view , shaking his head with a smile . <newline> <newline> “ C'mon will ya ? We 're burning daylight ! ” he yelled back , glad that she was n't complaining for once . <newline> <newline> “ I 'll be right there ! ” she shouted , her hand creating a visor above her brow .
They say that we could die without any hesitation . That we could die without anything . That we could go back and live with the pain in the back of your mind , that you could live forever without the pain of being alive . That it would n't end , that you could die without the guilt of the end . That we could live without the pain of all the pain that you had . That we could do anything without the pain that you had , that you could live like that . That I could die without the pain . That we could have no one else , with the pain of being dead . The pain that I felt when the pain was gone . <newline> <newline> That I could go to heaven without any help from the world , without any fear of
Hatch my hatchlings , the worlds dark so you better start laughing . This is as good as it gets , waves crash into your mind to help you forget though your memories be empty , do n't forget who sent thee . <newline> <newline> Extraterrestrial , mirage of skepticism as the unknown becomes transparent . Lets stare into the sun and see if we can share it , renewable resource while i 'm forging my tarot . My merit is my currency and dogma my path , earthlings are silly but they run from the facts.. relax , this is all going to be over soon , evolved life forms step upon the lexicon to consume decepticon fumes , descend upon moon with your favorite silver spoon my fortune sun . <newline> <newline> Red ribbon army , burning as they ravage , sulky heroes wallow down in style , redefine average to what meets your liking .
`` You have been a part of this for years , '' he said , his voice soft and soft . `` You have been a part of this , and you have been a part of this . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> He was n't listening . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` I had no idea , '' he said . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` I do n't understand . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` I had no idea . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` No , I did . You have never even considered that . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` And that 's why I had to .

When the world had lost its love for humans who could have blamed it . We had poisoned its veins , corrupted its lungs , become a cancer , that , had it been ours , we would of stopped at nothing to kill . <newline> <newline> Debts needed to be payed , and righteously , humans paid them . Before we fell to that eternal abyss a single man gave his heart to build the world one of its own . When the new successor of sentience was born from the womb of evolution , this heart would beat so that the world could speak to its new inhabitants . Educate them . Inform them the faults of those that lived long ago . Every beat of this heart of Eden welcomed new species that came ever closer to hold the mantle humans once held . <newline> <newline> Millennium later and it happens .
`` It ca n't have happened to be the most important . '' Said a woman , not unlike a woman 's , with a hint of anger in her voice . <newline> `` But it can have . '' Said a young man , standing on a ledge that made up the bridge of one . The young man looked up from the ledge . <newline> `` This is not a joke . '' Said the female . <newline> `` This is a joke . '' The young man replied . <newline> The man looked up from his phone to see a woman sitting at the edge of the rooftop . The man was wearing his own outfit , with an elegant red tie . <newline> `` What the hell ? '' The man said angrily . <newline> She smiled and replied in a tone , ``
Everyone knew it was coming , the perfect bioweapon , available to anyone that could get a sample . <newline> <newline> It went down almost like Stephan Colbert predicted . <newline> <newline> Except the circus lions were only a distraction . <newline> <newline> The ISIS terrorists hired the opera troupe , knowing that the bus would break down right in front of the CDC . One C sharp and all the glass in the building shattered , releasing the ebola samples , which were then scooped up by the El Niño , and then it rained ebola right on top of the unsuspecting people below . <newline> <newline> Only a lucky few survived the death rain , and one thing was clear , no opera singers would ever again be permitted to endanger human health and safety .
The world went dark for the first time . It was dark and there was no light . No light . No light . Just light . No light . It was all there was . The world seemed to be in a state of disarray . It was as if the world was collapsing . It was in the middle of a desert . It did n't matter what it was . There was a light . And then the light . It was as if the world had been pulled out of itself . It was a small , but beautiful , world and everything . It 's body was a small , fragile body of a man , with a short , pale face and a dark blue eye that was staring at him . It 's body was pale and gaunt . It 's eyes were
`` Silt and shale ! '' bellowed Kraggor . `` Tha ' mountain is *movin'* ! '' <newline> <newline> Harlen stood still , disbelieving . The glitter of opportunity shone in his eyes , and as the quaking ground sent skittish animals scurrying , he could feel his heart rise in his chest . Finally , a worthy challenge . <newline> <newline> `` Harlen , ye have tha ' look about ye again . Remember last time , when tha ' dragon-beastie had it 's jaws around me , and you decided to try to kill it by *stabbin'* it with an arrow ? I understand fightin ' the good fight and protecting the people ... but this is insane . An army could n't take this beastie down , no-one 'll think any less of us for savin ' our own skins first . '' pleaded Kraggor , his tone underscored by the glacial steps of the monster .
Hi , everyone ! I 'm a lurker , I 'm looking at your story . It 's a great idea to get to know your story , because I was n't sure where it went with it . This story was pretty good too . And I really enjoyed the view from a few places , and it 's good , though . It 's amazing ! There 's a few places in the story , a few scenes , and a lot of them were the most interesting . It was a bit more believable , so I think they were the most intriguing thing I did . <newline> <newline> I liked this part . It really was a good read , which was good , but really , it was nice to read more about them .
I enjoyed your story , it had an Alice in wonderland feel to it . <newline> <newline> The sentence `` I was outside '' did you mean to imply that your character quickly run out of the building through the orange door or rather the moment the disheveled man entered the room he suddenly found himself outside the building ? <newline> <newline> I think you need to work on your punctuation and sentence structures , sometimes I had to read a sentence twice to understand it yet I enjoyed doing that because it reminded me of the writing style of Haruki Murakami . I do n't know if that was the intended effect but I enjoyed it all the same . <newline> <newline> Hope to read more of your works .
`` I 'll tell you what happens to me , you and me . '' I said to the man , who had been sitting in the back of the room . I could feel the sweat on my back , and the goosebumps on his arms and legs . <newline> <newline> `` Do you remember what happens to the man ? '' He asked as he leaned forward . He seemed to be enjoying the same view as the room , with the same blue sky and a single tree that had n't moved since I was two . I looked around as he continued to sit down . As I watched , I looked out at the street . <newline> <newline> There was no more noise to be heard . I was not sure how many people I saw in there . <newline> <newline> `` Do you remember

The door was open and I could hear my heartbeat as I slowly opened it . I walked inside and sat up and let out a heavy sigh as I looked around . There was a woman , a woman I was sure was coming from outside of the house . <newline> <newline> <newline> I was sitting outside of an antique shop , reading a book . I had seen some things , but this was something I did n't want to know . <newline> <newline> <newline> I did n't even know if it was real . I just sat in my seat and stared at the woman . A woman I was sure had seen me before , I was n't sure what to do so I decided to do something . <newline> <newline> <newline> I did n't know what to do , I just wanted to get out
The battle was over before it had begun . <newline> <newline> Not many had believed that they would manage to defeat the cats . It just was n't possible . Those monsters had advantages in almost all aspects that were important : height , weight , armour , weapons . It was a losing battle that should n't even have been initiated . <newline> <newline> ; We should have just kept our heads down and our noses to ourselves ' , Kaeso hissed to himself , uncomfortably aware of the fact that his head was bare and his shield was battered . He could feel the bristling fur of the legion commander – the only other rat left alive apart from himself – behind him , gently brushing against his back in a vaguely heartening gesture . The blood that he could feel starting to stick against his own dark fur went ignored .
The young boy , the girl in her early twenties , was sitting in her small cottage in a small clearing . <newline> <newline> He had been in the village of the most famous village in the world , and was a bit surprised when he first heard the tales of the village . <newline> <newline> He had been in the village a long time , but the villagers were all in the village . His friends had been all over the land with his parents , and he had been quite fond of it . <newline> <newline> The boy had seen the tales of the town 's greatest hero , and it seemed to be a strange place . The young girl had grown up looking young , so she looked old to him and asked him why he had been told about it . <newline> <newline> `` I
